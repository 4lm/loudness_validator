**PLoud** project is published under multi-licensing, so you can choose between:
>* GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 (**LGPL**), see [LICENSE.LGPL3](LICENSE.LGPL3) file.
>* GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2 (**LGPL**), see [LICENSE.LGPL2](LICENSE.LGPL2) file.

This multi-licensing scheme applies to the whole project: applications, libraries and plug-ins.

The text below puts some clarrification regarding “derived work” definition.

Under the LGPL you may use the project for any purpose you wish, and modify it if you require, as long as you:
 1. Pass on the (modified) source code with your software, with original copyrights intact.
   1. If you distribute electronically, the source code can be a separate download – just include a link in your documentation.
   2. If you distribute physical media, the source code that you used to build your application should be included on that media.
 2. Make it clear where you have customised it.

In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exclusions and clarifications to the LGPL conditions apply to the project:
 1. Making modifications to configuration files, build scripts and configuration headers in order to create a customised build setup with the otherwise unmodified source code, does not constitute a derived work.
 2. Building against project headers which have inlined code does not constitute a derived work.
 3. Code which inherits project classes outside of the libraries does not form a derived work.
 4. Statically linking the project libraries into a user application does not make the user application a derived work.

As per the terms of the LGPL, a “derived work” is one for which you have to distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not a derived work, it means you don’t have to distribute source code for it.
However, the original source code with all modifications must always be made available.
